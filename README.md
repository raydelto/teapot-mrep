# About
Experiments with direct raytracing of Bézier surfaces, based on

- [Implicit matrix representations of rational Bézier curves and surfaces](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00847802/document)
- [A Line/Trimmed NURBS Surface Intersection Algorithm Using Matrix Representations](http://hal.cirad.fr/INRIASO/hal-01268109v1)

If you have issues building this project due to CMake not able to find Eigen, remember that you have to build Eigen (if you downloaded it from source) even though it's a header only library.
